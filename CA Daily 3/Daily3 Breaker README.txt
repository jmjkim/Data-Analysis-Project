"Daily3 Breaker.py" is a python language program which collects past drawing numbers of California Daily 3 Lottery and it was made for a purpose of self-learning python.

The past drawning numbers are posted under the past drawning number tap and numbers are listed throughout page 1 to 19.

The past drawning numbers are only 6 months worth data as the CA daily 3 website only permits to display past 6 months drawing numbers.


Use of my "Daily3 Breaker.py" program in any way of malicious, harmful or destructive is not my intention.
