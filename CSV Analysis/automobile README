This project is part of the IBM's Data Analyst Professional Certificate course.
Purpose of this project: An analysis of whether engine-size affects on price of a car or not.


#End result: 
engine-size is a good predictor on the price of a car by having an almost dignal regression line (as shown on the scatterplot) which indicates that when engine-size goes up, price goes up vice versa.

#Note:
rows that contains more than one of NaN (Not a Number, I treated as N/A) values are dropped for data cleansing
